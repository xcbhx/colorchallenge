# üé® Color Challenge
## ACS 3330: Assignment Overview (React, Javascript, CSS)
### This project is a simple React-based color guessing game.

### ‚úÖ Features:
* Displays three random color swatches (100px x 100px).

* Shows the hex value of one of the swatches.

* When a swatch is clicked:

  - ‚úÖ If it matches the displayed hex color, shows "Correct!"

  - ‚ùå Otherwise, shows "Incorrect!"

* Includes a "Play Again" button to reset the game.

### ü§ñ AI Prompts Used:
"Why isn't my square updating its background colors?"

"Give me a code review?"


The AI helped me better understand how to structure my code and explained that to dynamically update the square colors, I needed to use React state and inline styles, not just rely on static CSS.

### üß† What I Figured Out on My Own:
One thing I figured out on my own was how to set up the project using Vite + React. From there, I was able to implement each of the required steps, including designing the layout of the swatches and identifying the key variables needed for the game logic.
